    "There are many times when we might want to sort our data! In Python, lists have a `sort` method that actually changes the list, and sorts its elements from lowest to highest. (You can indicate that you want to sort in reverse order, if you want.)\n",

    "Don't use this method.  Don't sort things with `list.sort`!  There are several reasons:\n",

    "2. If you're dealing with strings, lists, or tuples, then `sorted` compares index 0 in both. If they're the same, it checks index 1. If those are the same, it checks index 2. This continues until (a) they're found to be equal, (b) one obviously comes first, or (c) one is shorter.\n"
