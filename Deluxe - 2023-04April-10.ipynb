    "There are many times when we might want to sort our data! In Python, lists have a `sort` method that actually changes the list, and sorts its elements from lowest to highest. (You can indicate that you want to sort in reverse order, if you want.)\n",

    "Don't use this method.  Don't sort things with `list.sort`!  There are several reasons:\n",

    "1. It assumes that all of the values in the input argument are comparable in general, and to one another.  Integers, floats, strings, lists, and tuples are all comparable. You can use `<` and `>` on any of them.  But you cannot compare integers with strings, or strings with lists.\n",
    "2. If you're dealing with strings, lists, or tuples, then `sorted` compares index 0 in both. If they're the same, it checks index 1. If those are the same, it checks index 2. This continues until (a) they're found to be equal, (b) one obviously comes first, or (c) one is shorter.\n",
    "3. `sorted` returns a new list, and doesn't modify its input argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious, `sorted` uses TimSort, written by ... Tim.  It combines heapsort and insertion sort, and generally works well if (a) you have big objects and (b) some of the values are already in order."
